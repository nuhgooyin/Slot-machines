# Slot machines

Martha takes a jar of quarters to the casino with the intention of becoming rich. She plays three machines in turn. Unknown to her, the machines are entirely predictable. Each play costs one
quarter. The first machine pays 30 quarters every 35th time it is played; the second machine pays 60 quarters every 100th time it is played; the third pays 9 quarters every 10th time it is played.

Your program should take as input the number of quarters in Martha's jar (there will be at least one and fewer than 1000), and the number of times each machine has been played since it last
paid.

Your program should output the number of times Martha plays until she goes broke. Input/output is not from/to files for this question. Keyboard input and screen output is expected.
